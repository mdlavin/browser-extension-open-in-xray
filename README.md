## Installing

The extension is available as both [a Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-aws-x-ray/pgenmgopbcfpinamahhelajhookfpboi) and [a Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-in-x-ray/)

## NOTE

Only the `correlationId` is supported right now. More links should be added
in the future and ideally they should be configurable through a extension
configuration UI.

## TODO

* Add configuration of supported attributes
